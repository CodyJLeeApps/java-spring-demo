If I were to review this application I would say that it has the following characteristics:
-Good example of Java and Java Spring implementation
-Example of using many tools (Eclipse JEE, Apache Tomcat, Maven, MySQL, etc)
-The application is very simple and to the point, no frills.
-Consistent coding standards


What I would add to the application:
1. User interface to: ADD, DELETE, UPDATE movie records.
2. Make the interface “pretty” create a nice UI and make it pleasing to the eye. 
3. Allow the user to re-run the application at-will
